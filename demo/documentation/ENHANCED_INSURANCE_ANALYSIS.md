- **Relevance Scoring**: Ranks search results by relevance to ensure the most accurate policy information
- **Fallback Support**: Gracefully handles API failures with intelligent fallback methods

### 2. Real GPT-5 Document Parsing
- **Live Policy Document Extraction**: Uses GPT-5 to download and parse actual medical policy documents
- **Intelligent Requirements Extraction**: Uses GPT-5's advanced NLP to extract specific insurance requirements from policy documents
- **Evidence Identification**: Identifies the clinical evidence and rationale behind coverage decisions
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Converts unstructured policy documents into structured, actionable data

### 3. GPT-5 Patient Criteria Matching
- **Intelligent Assessment**: Uses GPT-5 to compare patient data against extracted insurance requirements
- **Coverage Prediction**: Provides confidence scores for coverage likelihood
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing documentation or unmet criteria
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Considers clinical context and patient history in criteria evaluation

### 4. Enhanced Workflow Integration
- **Streamlined Process**: Reduces workflow from 5 steps to 4 steps
- **Real-time Updates**: Provides immediate feedback on coverage status and requirements
- **GPT-5 Recommendations Engine**: Generates intelligent, actionable recommendations for PA submission
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing workflow and database systems
